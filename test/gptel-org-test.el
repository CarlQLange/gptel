The asterisk (*) in =Lisp_Object *object_workspace;= is the pointer indirection operator in C. It indicates that =object_workspace= is a pointer to an object of type =Lisp_Object=. This means that =object_workspace= will store the memory address (location) of a =Lisp_Object= variable rather than storing the actual =Lisp_Object= value.

Therefore, =object_workspace= will be used to point to or reference locations in memory where =Lisp_Object= instances are stored. This allows the =struct json_parser= to store and work with =Lisp_Object= instances indirectly through pointers.")))
